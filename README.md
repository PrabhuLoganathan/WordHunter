____  
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  *- Automated online Treasure hunt*  

## Description :  
***Word-Hunter***  is an [Online Treasure Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_treasure_hunts "Online Treasure Hunt") game which is software automated (i.e .. A software that automatically prepares clues using online searches extensively) . All you'll have to do is to give it a **Topic of Interest** , and it'll search for different words relating to the topic and automatically set a question based on the frequency of words and other factors .  

## Requirements :  
* [Google custom search API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/ "Search API") (For both images and words)  
* [Beautiful Soup 4](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4 "Beautiful Soup")  
* [NLTK python](http://www.nltk.org/ "Natura language tool kit python")  

## Benefits :  
> This can easily be implemented on any python server (To host similar competitions) 
> You can also extract out some kind of a suggestion in the form of three words , in case you're setting questions for an online treasure hunt competition  
> You can always train it yourself when you're bored . Just feed in a lot of *Topics of Interest* !!  


## ToDo :  
[X] Implement a ``` Search Engine ``` to find out words similar to a given word  
[ ] Implement a ``` Word Analyzer ``` modules to find frequency of various words  
[ ] Implement an ``` Image Searcher ``` to get images related to the given term  
[ ] Include a loading bar , when the fetched URLs are being scrapped and when frequency is being calculated
